# Tushar_CPP_Codes
This project contains my self written CPP codes which compiled in Turbo compiler for various tasks during I was in 2nd semester.

The task for which the codes are uploaded as follow:

#In CPP-Code-1 following tasks are done:

Q1) Write a C++ program to calculate factorial of given numbers.

Q2) Write a C++ programs for the following pyramids.

Q3) Write a C++ program to accept numbers and print even numbers among them.

Q4) Write a program to check whether given number is prime or not.

Q5) Write a program to obtain N random numbers from Binomial, Poisson, Negative binomial, Hypergeometric and Multinomial distribution.

Q6)Write a C++ program to arrange the given numbers in ascending and descending order.

Q7) Write a C++ Program to find mean, variance of two variables separately and calculate covariance, correlation coefficient between two variables.

Q8) Write a C++ program to accept two matrices and print their addition and multiplication.

Q9) 9.Write a C++ program to evaluate ‚à´ ùê±^2 ùêùùê± limit from 0 to 10 by trapezoidal, Simpsons 1/3rd and Simpsons 3/8th rule

Q10) Write a C++ program to approximate the root of the equation x^3 + 2x^2 ‚àí 3 = 0 using Bisection method, Regula-Falsi method and Newton-Raphson method.

#In CPP-Code-1 following tasks are done:

1)Write a program that creates an ADT, time that stores three private integer values. hours, minute & 
seconds. Implement these using classes. The ADT should contain the function to ask the time from the 
user & display the time.

Q2) Create a class student that stores the information about a student. This information is entered a using 
the constructors. Create three different formats of the constructors. Implicit, parameterized and copy 
constructor.

Q3) Write overloaded function absolute( ) to find absolute value of given number.

Q4) Write overloaded function mean( ) to find arithmetic mean of int/float/double type array.

Q5) Overload an operator ‚Äò+‚Äô and ‚Äò*‚Äô to carry out the addition and multiplication of two complex numbers.

Q6) Create two classes Car & truck. First class had the data members, manufacturer, and max speed and 
second class has the data members max speed and capacity. Create a friend function greater_speed that 
is friendly with both the classes & it takes arguments of both class type & output the max_speed value 
of the two classes. 

Q7) Q7) Develop a matrix class that can handle integer matrices of different dimensions. Also overload 
operators ‚Äò+‚Äô, ‚Äò*‚Äô, ‚Äò=‚Äô to carry out addition, multiplication & comparison of two matrices.

Q8) Bank Program to Account credit, debit and showing bank balance.
