# Tushar_CPP_Codes
This project contains my self written CPP codes which compiled in Turbo compiler for various tasks during I was in 2nd semester.
The task for which the codes are uploaded as follow:
#In CPP-Code-1 following tasks are done:
Q1) Write a C++ program to calculate factorial of given numbers.
Q2) Write a C++ programs for the following pyramids.


Q3) Write a C++ program to accept numbers and print even numbers among them.
Q4) Write a program to check whether given number is prime or not.
Q5) Write a program to obtain N random numbers from Binomial, Poisson, Negative binomial, Hypergeometric and Multinomial distribution.
Q6)Write a C++ program to arrange the given numbers in ascending and descending order.
Q7) Write a C++ Program to find mean, variance of two variables separately and calculate covariance, correlation coefficient between two variables.
Q8) Write a C++ program to accept two matrices and print their addition and multiplication.
Q9) 9.Write a C++ program to evaluate ‚à´ ùê±^2 ùêùùê± limit from 0 to 10 by trapezoidal, Simpsons 1/3rd and Simpsons 3/8th rule
Q10) Write a C++ program to approximate the root of the equation x^3 + 2x^2 ‚àí 3 = 0 using Bisection method, Regula-Falsi method and Newton-Raphson method.
